  "text": "🎁 Launched just three months ago, Telegram gifts have become an internet sensation. This holiday season alone, Telegram users exchanged a record-breaking 20 million gifts 🎁🎁🎁\n\n📰 On January 1st, we introduced the ability to transform limited-edition gifts into unique collectibles. These can be transferred within Telegram and externally as NFTs. Minting a unique gift costs just 25 Stars, which is spent on the TON blockchain fees required to mint the NFT 🎁🎁🎁\n\n🏆 Our artists have designed countless versions of 21 limited-edition gifts and are already working on the next 25. The level of artistic effort invested in this project has been incredible. We got so carried away that, for some gifts, we ended up paying our artists more than the revenue they generated 🎁🎁🎁\n\n💵 I hear that third-party NFT marketplaces are already working on enabling auctions for minted Telegram gifts. It will be exciting to see how this ecosystem evolves 🎁🎁🎁",

In just 12 days, 15,000 affiliate programs were created, and 4 million users got referred to mini apps 📈\n\n😇 The Affiliate Platform gives channels and mini apps what they need most: channel owners earn revenue, while mini app developers gain new users. Unlike similar systems, Telegram's Affiliate Platform is transparent and guarantees instant commissions each time a referred user makes a transaction in a mini app🪙\n\n😺 Above all, it’s simple. Anyone can start or join an affiliate program on Telegram. You can view existing affiliate programs in “My Stars” in Settings (choose “Earn Stars”).

In the future, this new bottom bar will also store web pages and other content for later reading.\n \n💫 This update also introduces the ability for channel owners to publish paid photos and videos, which users can buy with Stars. Like mini app developers, channel owners can convert the Stars they collect into Toncoin, with virtually no commission from Telegram.\n\n#️⃣ The newest version of Telegram also includes other features like hashtag and location search for public Stories.
